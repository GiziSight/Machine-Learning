# Documentation
1. To use the notebook for modeling, you can simply download or clone it and make sure to install the dependencies. Once you have done that, ensure that you have all the required data and enter the path folder where your data is stored. or if you use a google collab you can import the notebook then run it, and make sure you enter the filepath where your data is stored
2. To use the notebook for image repair, make sure you already have the data and enter the path folder where your data is stored.
